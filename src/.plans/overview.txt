going to add 3d now.

high tension = good, survival = good, grinding/scoring up = mediocre
star trek had an ok formula - because there's an antagonist.
we need something similar here - klingon equivalents who try to conquer systems. 
if they succeed, a klingon fleet sits there. so you can't use it to repair, buy goods etc until you liberate it.
maybe they do this by blockading... and maybe the target system gives up instead of fighting so their defense fleet is preserved.
also you should be able to conquer systems by fighting their defense fleet. 
this gives 4 alignments naturally
conquer - evil
liberate - good
both - chaotic
neither - pure neutral (boringcore)

to actually increase tension we need to make a chance some bugs will attack the player if he travels to a system they're blokading or control
ie world gets scarier

and we also need to make flee not guaranteed to work, escape pods limited, and ship can be destroyed (you can actually die/lose)

there's also the concept of score for prestige players - ie, total systems conquered, liberated, etc.
and to make the world "live" a little more we can have the still free systems occasionally send out their own liberation fleets (player, bug, doesnt matter)
and some "classes" naturally arise
trader - dont give a shit about anything and just trade at free systems
smuggler - make dangerous runs into bug held space, or just transmit illegal cargo
warrior - fight the shit out of bugs OR defense fleets, whatever
some others may be possible too.
